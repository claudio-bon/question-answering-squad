James Ashley of Ohio, for the territory that would become Idaho Territory. The name was successfully changed by Representatives Henry Wilson (Massachusetts) and Benjamin F. Harding (Oregon), who complained that Montana had \"no meaning\". When Ashley presented a bill to establish a temporary government in 1864 for a new territory to be carved out of Idaho, he again chose Montana Territory. This time Rep. Samuel Cox, also of Ohio, objected to the name. Cox complained that the name was a misnomer given that most of the territory was not mountainous and that a Native American name would be more appropriate than a Spanish one. Other names such as Shoshone were suggested, but it was eventually decided that the Committee on Territories could name it whatever they wanted, so the original name of Montana was adopted.", "qas": [{"question": "Where does the state's name mean?", "id": "5733f18ad058e614000b6643"}, {"question": "What did the Spanish call this region?", "id": "5733f18ad058e614000b6644"}]}, {"context": "With a total area of 147,040 square miles (380,800 km2), Montana is slightly larger than Japan.

Intrinsic antibacterial resistance may be part of the genetic makeup of bacterial strains. For example, an antibiotic target may be absent from the bacterial genome. Acquired resistance results from a mutation in the bacterial chromosome or the acquisition of extra-chromosomal DNA. Antibacterial-producing bacteria have evolved resistance mechanisms that have been shown to be similar to, and may have been transferred to, antibacterial-resistant strains. The spread of antibacterial resistance often occurs through vertical transmission of mutations during growth and by genetic recombination of DNA by horizontal genetic exchange. For instance, antibacterial resistance genes can be exchanged between different bacterial strains or species via plasmids that carry these resistance genes. Plasmids that carry several different resistance genes can confer resistance to multiple antibacterials. Cross-resistance to several antibacterials may also occur when a resistance mechanism encoded by a single gene conveys resistance to more than one antibacterial compound.", "qas": [{"question": "What is part of hje the make up of bacterial strains?", "id": "5731c904b9d445190005e551"}, {"question": "What is exchanged between between bacterial strains or species via plasmids that have this resistance?", "id": "5731c904b9d445190005e554"}, {"question": "What can be absent from the bacterial genome?", "id": "5731c904b9d445190005e552"}, {"question": "When does the spread of antibacterial resistance frequently occurs/", "id": "5731c904b9d445190005e553"}, {"question": "What does some resistance come from?", "id": "5733c3f34776f419006611d4"}, {"question": "What method of spread can occur in antibacterial resistance?", "id": "5733c3f34776f419006611d5"}, {"question": "What do plasmids do in resistance?", "id": "5733c3f34776f419006611d6"}]}, {"context": "Antibacterial-resistant strains and species, sometimes referred to as \"superbugs\", now contribute to the emergence of diseases that were for a while well controlled.

Bach for three keyboards; and, on 3 March 1838, a concert in which Chopin, his pupil Adolphe Gutmann, Charles-Valentin Alkan, and Alkan's teacher Joseph Zimmermann performed Alkan's arrangement, for eight hands, of two movements from Beethoven's 7th symphony. Chopin was also involved in the composition of Liszt's Hexameron; he wrote the sixth (and final) variation on Bellini's theme. Chopin's music soon found success with publishers, and in 1833 he contracted with Maurice Schlesinger, who arranged for it to be published not only in France but, through his family connections, also in Germany and England.", "qas": [{"question": "What was Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric's favorite environment to perform in?", "id": "56cbfa0e6d243a140015ee2d"}, {"question": "What instrument did Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric play in a performance on 23 March 1833?", "id": "56cbfa0e6d243a140015ee2e"}, {"question": "Chopin gave a yearly performance where?", "id": "56cf75794df3c31400b0d7d1"}, {"question": "Chopin worked with Liszt on what piece?", "id": "56cf75794df3c31400b0d7d2"}, {"question": "In 1833 with whom with Chopin work to get his music published?", "id": "56cf75794df3c31400b0d7d3"}, {"question": "What is the name of Chopin's pupil who performed with him?", "id": "56cf75794df3c31400b0d7d4"}, {"question": "Where did Chopin prefer to play for people?", "id": "56d31dcb59d6e41400146259"}, {"question": "On March 23, 1833, who headlined and performed with Chopin at a concert?", "id": "56d31dcb59d6e4140014625b"}, {"question": "Who did Chopin contract with for publishing his music?", "id": "56d31dcb59d6e4140014625c"}]}, {"context": "In the spring of 1834, Chopin attended the Lower Rhenish Music Festival in Aix-la-Chapelle with Hiller, and it was there that Chopin met Felix Mendelssohn. After the festival, the three visited D\u00fcsseldorf, where Mendelssohn had been appointed musical director. They spent what Mendelssohn described as \"a very agreeable day\", playing and discussing music at his piano, and met Friedrich Wilhelm Schadow, director of the Academy of Art, and some of his eminent pupils such as Lessing, Bendemann, Hildebrandt and Sohn. In 1835 Chopin went to Carlsbad, where he spent time with his parents; it was the last time he would see them. On his way back to Paris, he met old friends from Warsaw, the Wodzi\u0144skis. He had made the acquaintance of their daughter Maria in Poland five years earlier, when she was eleven. This meeting prompted him to stay for two weeks in Dresden, when he had previously intended to return to Paris via Leipzig. The sixteen-year-old girl's portrait of the composer is considered, along with Delacroix's, as among Chopin's best likenesses. In October he finally reached Leipzig, where he met Schumann, Clara Wieck and Felix Mendelssohn, who organised for him a performance of his own oratorio St. Paul, and who considered him \"a perfect musician\". In July 1836 Chopin travelled to Marienbad and Dresden to be with the Wodzi\u0144ski family, and in September he proposed to Maria, whose mother Countess Wodzi\u0144ska approved in principle. Chopin went on to Leipzig, where he presented Schumann with his G minor Ballade. At the end of 1836 he sent Maria an album in which his sister Ludwika had inscribed seven of his songs, and his 1835 Nocturne in C-sharp minor, Op. 27, No. 1. The anodyne thanks he received from Maria proved to be the last letter he was to have from her.", "qas": [{"question": "Who did Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric meet in the spring of 1834 at the Lower Rhenish Music Festival?", "id": "56cbfbdd6d243a140015ee36"}, {"question": "What two activities did Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric do while visiting for a day in D\u00fcsseldorf with Mendelssohn and Hiller?", "id": "56cbfbdd6d243a140015ee37"}, {"question": "Who was the director of the Academy of Art that Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric met while in D\u00fcsseldorf?", "id": "56cbfbdd6d243a140015ee38"}, {"question": "Where were Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric's parents located at when he saw them for the final time in 1835?", "id": "56cbfbdd6d243a140015ee39"}, {"question": "Where did Chopin meet Felix Mendelssohn?", "id": "56cf7b8a4df3c31400b0d81f"}, {"question": "Who did Chopin attend the Lower Rhenish Music Festival with?", "id": "56cf7b8a4df3c31400b0d820"}, {"question": "In 1835 where did Chopin and his parents visit?", "id": "56cf7b8a4df3c31400b0d821"}, {"question": "When did Chopin propose marriage to Maria Wodzi\u0144ski?", "id": "56cf7b8a4df3c31400b0d822"}, {"question": "Who was Maria's mother?", "id": "56cf7b8a4df3c31400b0d823"}, {"question": "Who did Chopin meet at a music festival early in 1834?", "id": "56d31f8a59d6e41400146262"}, {"question": "Where did Chopin and Hiller go with the person Chopin met in the spring of 1834?", "id": "56d31f8a59d6e41400146263"}, {"question": "What was Friedrich Wilhelm Schadow position?", "id": "56d31f8a59d6e41400146264"}, {"question": "What was the first name of the girl Chopin proposed to?", "id": "56d31f8a59d6e41400146266"}]}, {"context": "Although it is not known exactly when Chopin first met Liszt after arriving in Paris, on 12 December 1831 he mentioned in a letter to his friend Woyciechowski that \"I have met Rossini, Cherubini, Baillot, etc.\u2014also Kalkbrenner.

The second successor of this first Tsang king, Karma Phuntsok Namgyal, took control of the whole of Central Tibet (\u00dc-Tsang), reigning from 1611\u20131621. Despite this, the leaders of Lhasa still claimed their allegiance to the Phagmodru as well as the Gelug, while the \u00dc-Tsang king allied with the Karmapa. Tensions rose between the nationalistic \u00dc-Tsang ruler and the Mongols who safeguarded their Mongol Dalai Lama in Lhasa. The fourth Dalai Lama refused to give an audience to the \u00dc-Tsang king, which sparked a conflict as the latter began assaulting Gelug monasteries. Chen writes of the speculation over the fourth Dalai Lama's mysterious death and the plot of the \u00dc-Tsang king to have him murdered for \"cursing\" him with illness, although Chen writes that the murder was most likely the result of a feudal power struggle. In 1618, only two years after Yonten Gyatso died, the Gelug and the Karma Kargyu went to war, the Karma Kargyu supported by the secular \u00dc-Tsang king. The \u00dc-Tsang ruler had a large number of Gelugpa lamas killed, occupied their monasteries at Drepung and Sera, and outlawed any attempts to find another Dalai Lama. In 1621, the \u00dc-Tsang king died and was succeeded by his young son Karma Tenkyong, an event which stymied the war effort as the latter accepted the six-year-old Lozang Gyatso as the new Dalai Lama. Despite the new Dalai Lama's diplomatic efforts to maintain friendly relations with the new \u00dc-Tsang ruler, Sonam Rapten (1595\u20131657), the Dalai Lama's chief steward and treasurer at Drepung, made efforts to overthrow the \u00dc-Tsang king, which led to another conflict. In 1633, the Gelugpas and several thousand Mongol adherents defeated the \u00dc-Tsang king's troops near Lhasa before a peaceful negotiation was settled.
